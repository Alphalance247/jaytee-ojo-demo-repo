          The JayTee Ojo Foundation believes that strong educators are the key
          to lasting change. Through this initiative, we provide teachers and
          trainers with practical tools, mentorship, and training in ICT and
          innovative teaching methods. By equipping educators with the skills
          and confidence to deliver high-quality lessons, we ensure that
          students not only learn but are inspired to explore, create, and
          thrive. This approach multiplies the impact of our programs, building
          a sustainable culture of learning and growth across schools and
          communities.
