          What do you want to be in future? What do you want to be when you grow
          up? I remember being asked this question as a little boy and you may
          have been asked the same question in a variety of ways. When I was a
          boy, I wanted to be a doctor however at the age of 13, I started my
          first business and my first money.

          I had wanted to call my uncle in New York, so, I went to the post
          office in Ado Ekiti and bought 100 units NITEL Phone Card. For young
          people wondering what that is (see picture attached), it is like a
          debit or credit card, it had a chip which stored phone calling units
          which ran down as you called in the public phone booths.
